Description

Create a headless mode for generating output files programmatically based on defined module interfaces. This will enable "mail merge"-like capabilities for creating output files based on data.

As noted in the backlog: "If we are able to define a module interface for a particular output, we should be able to enable a sort of headless mode for generating output files. This in turn will enable 'mail merge' like capabilities for creating output files based on data."

Technical Requirements

Define standard module interfaces for outputs
Implement CLI/API mode
Support data-driven parametrization
Enable batch processing
Error handling and logging
Acceptance Criteria

Headless operation via command line or API
Parameter configuration via external data
Proper output file generation
Documentation for usage
